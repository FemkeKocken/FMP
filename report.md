 Started this doc because it would make more sense here,  but I am not yet sure how much sense it will make to keep track of the development of the framework. But it will make sense to keep it all together I think. 
 
### tips from lecture: ask yourself 1) What? 2) So what? 3) Now what? ###

I suppose that what I eventually have to write is a design process report I will have to write about the following parts: 
### 1 
    - Societal problem
        - What? using natural language with GAI tools, engrained personality withing GAI tools, and the relationship with these tools. 
        - Why? People are very concerned about how to stay in control over GAI, one way of doing this is to present GAI as a subordinate helper. 
        - Now what? 
        
    - Research hypothesis 
        - Taking a stance on the topic 
            - Subservience and free thinking GAI do not go hand-in-hand in the way that tech is currently presenting. This should be changed. (it can tell you anything in the world, but it will never disagree with you) 
            - by giving people a prototype that mimicks this to an extreme extend I want to trigger discussion on the relationship towards tools that we talk with and natural language. 
 ### 2            
    - Theorectical framework 
        - (post) phenomenology
        - technological relationships 
        - GAI and natural language 
        - GAI and personality
  ### 3       
    - Methodology 
        - Speculative design research 
        - Grounded theory 
        - Testing prototype 
            - participants 
            - questionaires
  ### 4        
    - Design process / Prototype development 
        - design parallels? 
            - going from personality in GAI, to extreme personality, to helpfulness, to complete subservience and free thinking. 
        - Look and feel of TSM
        - Building TSM 
 ### 5        
 
    - Results
        - graphs? 
    - Analysis 
    - Discussion 
### 6 
    - Conclusion
