I guess I need to define what I mean with human-like and which emotions I want to mimick, asss well as thinking of a good service. Maybe I could repurpose and make some new Figma prototypes. See what digital services I can make as wel as generate. Hand those of to people and see how they react? 

## Entry 13/09/2023 ##

Made a draft proposal/set-up. If I'm smart I can repurpose some of the bits of lat project's theorectical framework. 
I would want to do something in the vain of exploring human-like emotions in digital service as to comment on friendly UX design and derealization. 

Immersion relationships with human-like digital services? 
‘’I woke up and my smart-toaster told me it thinks it has a burn-out. I asked it if that was a good or a bad thing, and now it refuses to talk to me.’’

I’ve been toying around with prompts for GAI, like GPT and interacting with this human-like chatbot. Rilla (my prof at Concordia) mentioned that it’s interesting that these human-like interactions feel much more real but they are opposed to the friendliness seen in classic UX/UI design. My last project left of at a point where I concluded that assumed trust in immersive technological relationships (see Peter Paul Verbeek and Don Ihde) is key to designing digital services with embedded GAI. 
What I would want to research with this project would be: how do human-like interaction within digital services as opposed to UX/UI friendly interactions influence the experience of derealization and depersonalization. So basically, if these friendly slick services would start to behave and interact with you like humans (getting bored, sad, angry) would that create less or more mental friction, which is at the root of de personalization and derealization. 
I could do this by doing what I do best, making (semi) deranged prototypes of services that don’t exist, handing them of to users and gain data from it. It could be a diary study maybe? 


-need to define:
-what kinds of services are we looking at here
-what are human-like interactions? 
-How to test this

Draft research set-up: 
-Introduction 
Digital services, what is it and which ones are we looking at 
Technological mediation is going to happen no matter what 
Depersonalization and derealization, what is it, how bad is it exactly and how does it happen (tech. mediation of a service goes wrong)
UX/UI design, what is it and what are the rules, it is often very friendly and the aim is to create good experiences, but it doesn’t always succeed. 
LLMs are an emergent technology, what is it, and it enables us to create human-like conversations
How would derealization and depersonalization be influenced if we would switch the UX friendliness for human-like conversation?

Theo framework:
Philosophy of technology
(Post-)phenomenology 
Technological relations (espcially immersive relationships)
 
Innate technology seems to lessen derealization and depersonalization. Is that true? 

Approach/ methods:
-speculative design? 
-design parallels (2 track theoretical framework and creative making. Bounce in between these two and end by comparing the creative making to the literature, to reflect upon the literature)
-make a human-like service prototype and let people AB test it? 
-Diary study? 

Results: 
-fancy schmancy prototypes 
-cool visuals 
-qualitative results from the diary study 

Discussion: 
-reflection on the prototypes/making
-reflecting on the results from the testing 
-reflection on the literature framework 

Conclusion:
How do human-like interactions within digital service influence the experience of depersonalization and derealization?

I made a planning yesterday. Might not do as much on the project today as I am up to day, will probably start tomorrow morning with the scope and definitions, then research plan and then the draft theorectical framework. The last one I should probably run past Minha.

Test. Set up repo. 

Okay cool, still works. I will have to start sketching a timeline and upload it soon. If I want to pass this project I'll have to start soon, get the theory out of the way so the struggle of actually making something can take as long as it needs.
