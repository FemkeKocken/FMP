I made a planning yesterday. Might not do as much on the project today as I am up to day, will probably start tomorrow morning with the scope and definitions, then research plan and then the draft theorectical framework. The last one I should probably run past Minha.

Test. Set up repo. 

Okay cool, still works. I will have to start sketching a timeline and upload it soon. If I want to pass this project I'll have to start soon, get the theory out of the way so the struggle of actually making something can take as long as it needs.
