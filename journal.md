So for now I want to work on the designs of a page in Figma as well as realization and using tools to go from Figma to React to Gitpages. In the meanwhile I can also work on my portfolio.. But the main problem I am still facing is concept related so I'm not sure how to solve for that.. 

I currently have the following problems: 
 - concept
    - I want to do something realted to letting users interact with 'negative' personality qualities, let them interact with a website/computer/interface and gage their responses. Right now I'm working with OCEAN as a personality model and a virtual assistent as the interface. However, I'm not really sure how to best glue this together conceptually as well as in a way that something can be tested in the end 
 - realization
   - so I found some tool and a method which I can use to make things, which I will have to test. However this is going to be hard and is going to take up way more time than is expected which kinda makes me nervous. 
 - testing
    - again I'm thinking of diary studies, but there is the time factor.. I think my main worries right now are with the concept.
 - time
    - right now the planning is out of the window untill I have a better grasp on the project, which stresses me out

I think this was a very productive week, Shahrom helped me nail some things down, I've finally finished the sketch and the figma draft. I want to keep exploring styles and see what I can realize. I am in despreate need of meetings wit Rilla or Minha though... Hope that will be next week. 
Other than that, I think I did good. 

## Entry 26/10/2026 ##

I'm now learning more about Figma and React. So far this  is going pretty okay. I'm getting better at both. 
I'm also working on the visual style of the potential prototype. 

## Entry 24/10/2023 ##

I got help from Shahrom, which I'll include in the prototype jorunal. There are some limitations in regards to the realization. 
I also got feedback from Rilla that she doesn't think it would be a good idea to have a set personality... 
I feel like I'm going somewhere but at the same time I'm getting stuck. 
I was going to have a call with Rachel today, see what she thinks, and maybe I can set something up with Rilla? 


## Entry 20/10/2023 ##
Had a bit of a hard time of getting to work again.. However I do have made some process, which I am going to track in a seperate prototype log/document/situation so I can keep this mostly for updates on the general status of the project. 

I should review and adapt my planning. 

need to do next week: 
 - review planning
 - set up something tastable 
 - make something
 - start eying up testers
 - build some sort of rationale behind this
 - have some pretty stock images or whatever for the report.
 - check in with Rachel, see what see has to say about this from a research point of view
 - maybe talk to Shahrom again about my options.

I have 2 more offcial weeks of building left. I have spent the first two  essentially getting stuck in the 'I'm not good enough zone' I need to start cristalize questions that I need answered as well as their answers. 

Questions: 
 - Why a personal assistent?
      - pure form of human-computer interaction? 
 - which character traits?
     - big 5/OCEAN personality?
 - WHat are the quiz questions going to be like?
     - let them take the big 5/OCEAN testand use those values as a starting point. 
 - What should the looks of the prototype be? (make 3-ish sketches) 
 - Ask Shahrom what I could do with my skills and with the time I have

 Okay right now I want to focus on the why and which, and maybe I can propose some quiz questions based on that as well. And make 2 sketches, one of a potential look and feel of the quiz and one of the assistent itself. 
 
 
 
## Entry 04/10/2023 ##

okay I was struggling a bit for the last couple weeks, because I wasn't sure what I was going to make and how. But I got out of it by making problems smaller and tangible as well as complaining to an UX/UI designer. Great.  

I think I know what I want to do. Build a GAI search engine AMA. with a personality that can be controlled through sliders. User will be able to set the first personality through a short quiz, and are then able to use the site as a search engine with personality. During the research I want to ask participants to keep a journal and to optimize their experience of the platform through the sliders. They don't know what the sldiers directly correspond to, but they are negative qualities. 

What I am interested in, if which qualities and in which amount, will be usefull to the user. My guess is that a little sadness directness and clumsiness will probably be popular. 

What I still need: 
1. look and feel of app
2. quiz
3. what personality traits should be included

Once I have these I should be able to make a Figma or a Balsamic before I can start asking around to build an actual thing using GPT. 

## Entry 19/09/2023 ##
I want to get as far as I can by making pressure cooker prototypes to test this and next week. I have four concepts down already;  A human-like PA, human-like in-app notifications, human-like tutorials and a human social media manager. 

1. PA: you do a quiz to detirmen the tone of the bot, will be able to plan or not plan searches, appointments, etc. similar to Google assistent
2. whatsapp updates: in a human-like way, woul gain data from your chats
3. tutorial: gain data from account plus a short quiz, takes you through the set-up of an app (spotify)
4. Social media manager: Take data from your account and quiz, will help you improve your images. (clippy reuse)

What I need are wireframes, and low-fi Figmas to hand of to some people. 

## Entry 14/09/2023 ##
I guess I need to define what I mean with human-like and which emotions I want to mimick, asss well as thinking of a good service. Maybe I could repurpose and make some new Figma prototypes. See what digital services I can make as wel as generate. Hand those of to people and see how they react? 

made another short deranged story! 



Should also spend some time on making something creative to set the tone of the project. 
## Entry 13/09/2023 ##

Made a draft proposal/set-up. If I'm smart I can repurpose some of the bits of lat project's theorectical framework. 
I would want to do something in the vain of exploring human-like emotions in digital service as to comment on friendly UX design and derealization. 

Immersion relationships with human-like digital services? 
‘’I woke up and my smart-toaster told me it thinks it has a burn-out. I asked it if that was a good or a bad thing, and now it refuses to talk to me.’’

I’ve been toying around with prompts for GAI, like GPT and interacting with this human-like chatbot. Rilla (my prof at Concordia) mentioned that it’s interesting that these human-like interactions feel much more real but they are opposed to the friendliness seen in classic UX/UI design. My last project left of at a point where I concluded that assumed trust in immersive technological relationships (see Peter Paul Verbeek and Don Ihde) is key to designing digital services with embedded GAI. 
What I would want to research with this project would be: how do human-like interaction within digital services as opposed to UX/UI friendly interactions influence the experience of derealization and depersonalization. So basically, if these friendly slick services would start to behave and interact with you like humans (getting bored, sad, angry) would that create less or more mental friction, which is at the root of de personalization and derealization. 
I could do this by doing what I do best, making (semi) deranged prototypes of services that don’t exist, handing them of to users and gain data from it. It could be a diary study maybe? 


-need to define:
-what kinds of services are we looking at here
-what are human-like interactions? 
-How to test this

Draft research set-up: 
-Introduction 
Digital services, what is it and which ones are we looking at 
Technological mediation is going to happen no matter what 
Depersonalization and derealization, what is it, how bad is it exactly and how does it happen (tech. mediation of a service goes wrong)
UX/UI design, what is it and what are the rules, it is often very friendly and the aim is to create good experiences, but it doesn’t always succeed. 
LLMs are an emergent technology, what is it, and it enables us to create human-like conversations
How would derealization and depersonalization be influenced if we would switch the UX friendliness for human-like conversation?

Theo framework:
Philosophy of technology
(Post-)phenomenology 
Technological relations (espcially immersive relationships)
 
Innate technology seems to lessen derealization and depersonalization. Is that true? 

Approach/ methods:
-speculative design? 
-design parallels (2 track theoretical framework and creative making. Bounce in between these two and end by comparing the creative making to the literature, to reflect upon the literature)
-make a human-like service prototype and let people AB test it? 
-Diary study? 

Results: 
-fancy schmancy prototypes 
-cool visuals 
-qualitative results from the diary study 

Discussion: 
-reflection on the prototypes/making
-reflecting on the results from the testing 
-reflection on the literature framework 

Conclusion:
How do human-like interactions within digital service influence the experience of depersonalization and derealization?

I made a planning yesterday. Might not do as much on the project today as I am up to day, will probably start tomorrow morning with the scope and definitions, then research plan and then the draft theorectical framework. The last one I should probably run past Minha.

## Entry 05/09/2023 ## 
Test. Set up repo. 

Okay cool, still works. I will have to start sketching a timeline and upload it soon. If I want to pass this project I'll have to start soon, get the theory out of the way so the struggle of actually making something can take as long as it needs.
