Hallelujah! I inally finsih that damn "quick'' easy sketch I was going to do lol.

I still kind of like the unstable identity glitch idea. Or trying to communicate the idea of instability and fluidity through the design of the app 

## Entry 25/10/2023 - realization ##

So now I am looking into React, and the idea is to make a Figma prototype, and see if that can be turned into React with a tool. I suppose that from there I can ask for help in letting it make API calls to GPT. 

The planning for now is out of the window. 
I really need some support from Rilla and/or Minha... 

I'll also have to look more into learning to understand React and find a tool to go from Figma to React. 

As far for the tool, my first Youtube tutorial attempt is actually making it seem like it's not too much of a hassle. 
SO far I've learned that there's Vite or kind of a slower way to go from Figma to React JS 
and theres the Rendition tool that will create component directly. 
I'll have to watch these full tutorials sometime soon to see if that would work. 

## Entry 24/10/2023 - maybe go back to drawing board ##

Just spoke to Rachel, she mentioned that maybe the whole assistent thing is not going to work out...  
However some other things I could try in the meanwhil is to WoZ somethings, or influence apps. I can also look up React Native. 
I definitly need a chat with Rilla to iron some things down because I need to make soething real soon. 

one thing I do know: is that I want to stimulate discussion around human-like interactions with computers. 

I'm just not sure what I want exactly. 

Rachel also mentioned mturk, red door and snow crash. 

## Entry 24/10/2023 -realization ## 

So Shahrom, Max and Rilla helped me out a lot by explaining the inner workings of it all and what I can best do in order to make this work: 

So I got very stuck on the realization part, as I didn't know how to code and there would be inbetween, 2^5=32 and 5^5=3125 variation based on the slider idea, all with a certain personality tied to it. Essentially way too much. 

What I want is to design a front end with a method of calling GPT over the web. Therefore, mobile design should be left to rest for nowand I should focus on making a working webpage first. Since ky skills in HTML and CSS are basic and incredibly dusty and my skill in JS basically non-existent. I will probably have to use libraries to bear the main load of the prototyping. I was recommended: React, React Native, Angular, Svelte, NextJS, and Nest JS. The can function as a foundation for the webpage and will save me time and effort. As for the realization this will mean that I should look into React Native and look for tools that would turn a Figma file into code/React Native. 

As for the concept having to set different personalities will probably make it harder to code. While having only one set personality would be hard to arguea s to go for which personality exactly. I'm kinda of stuck on this..

## etnry 21/10/2023 ##

Okay so Max adviced to maybe do one type personality, like Rilla said and base that on the average personality of the people I ask. THat way I would only  have to mae 1 prototype/chatbot. WHich would narrow things down quite a lot. I should also ask Shahrom and Rachel on their opinions. I could ask Miriam for a relieable questionaire. 

From there I would also need to nail down the following: 
 - What type of participant
 - how many participants
 - how to approach the diary study
 - what questions should I ask 

Perhaps this list should be better in the journal? not  sure 

## Entry 20/10/2023 ##

SO far I've received help from Max and Rilla. 
THey also advised me not to continue to think about actually realizing this because it is simply put, too much dam work. 
However, I could continue with a single setting. 

### Question: whih setting/personality should that be and why? ###

alright I'll get bck to you tomorrow. As I also want to finish a drawing so I have atleast something to point when talking about this concept, you know.

## Entry 20/10/2023 ##

I thought it could be interesting to keep a log of the development of my prototype here (I guess that was part of whole GaR project, I'm just a bigger idiot than people think) 
Anways, okay so I don't have too much time right now so I'll copy paste the beginning of the concept here and I guess I'll add more to it later. 

right now I am mostly interested in building a virtual assistant/chatbot that would utilize the big 5 (OCEAN) personality traits. The assistant would be to create a direct interaction and relationship between user and LLM. The research question would be something along the lines of: How do users respond to the introduction of human-like personalities within assistants?  
 
In an ideal world where I could do everything want, I would love to make would be a site/platform/app. For now, letâ€™s say a website, that would have a chat window as well as 5 unmarked sliders corresponding to these 5 traits and give those off to users. I would ideally let users test on the 5 personality traits, and base the starting values for the site on these results (so a personality similar to their own). I would then follow the users over the span of a couple days, and let them play around with the settings, give them some daily tasks, probably doing a diary study. I would close it off with an interview on the user experience and what settings they preferred in what situations and if I could comment on current trend and UX design in general. 
 
However, this is not an ideal world, and I am honestly not sure how to go about this and realize this. I am going to look more into this myself as well, and see how far I could get, but there is also very limited time given the TUe calendar. I could see if I could use Github pages and maybe even generate parts of the code? 
Any and all advise would help a lot.
