New legistlation for the US and GAI https://www.wired.com/story/joe-bidens-executive-order-ai-us-government-chatgpt/ 

''...the Defense Production Act, a law that can compel businesses to take actions in the interest of national security, to require the makers of large AI models to report key information to the government, including when they are training a new model and what cybersecurity protections they have.''

''Another part of the order requires companies that acquire, develop, or possess large-scale computing clusters, essential to training the most powerful AI systems, to report their activity to the federal government. This rule is intended to help the government understand which entities, including those from nations competing with the US, have strong AI capabilities.''

It's intersting to see how the US is almost weaponizing GAI, as well as forcing direct opportunity for the government. Since I'm only making GPT calls, in the best scenario, I don't think this applies to me persé. However, if I wanted to actually make this, the source of the model should be explainable, key information should be collected and presented, and explain what cyber security is set in place.

SO I'm trying to make a dark version of a webpage, but honestly I might have to put it to rest for now and pick it back up next week. I'm a little exhausted. 

Did also find this image: 
blue-ish computer face design kinda vibe. Which would be a cool thing I could potentially explore. Why the added middle man of a assistent, if you could also speak to your laptop directly?
I could take this idea into potential meetings as well.

## Entry 27/10/2023 - Business ##
In the meanwhile I'm just now reading about this new article that has passed UK law surrounding digital safety. It's pretty controversial. Moest importantly messages can now get scanned to filter out illegal content
''Some of the more nuanced principles around the harms caused by legal but harmful content have been watered down, and added in is a highly divisive requirement for messaging platforms to scan users’ messages for illegal material, such as child sexual abuse material, which tech companies and privacy campaigners say is an unwarranted attack on encryption.''

also: 
-age requirements 
-reporting concerns
-any treats of suicide, murder, cyberbullying and deepfake porn must be removed from the platform.

## Entry 26/10/2023 - Realization ##
Okay I think I've found a good tool to use, Locofy. This will help me to turn a Figma file into React.js in such a way that I would almost believe I could then host it on Github (this is going be great for my portfolio, but I can't do it for the prototype as you can't publish a GPT key online..)
This could be promising. I could try and make an aesthically better version and see if I could upload it to Git pages to test the waters? 


## Entry 26/10/2023 - Aesthetics ##

Finished the first figma desktop sketch. FINALLY. 

![image](https://github.com/FemkeKocken/FMP/assets/50365794/c00a51c4-f09d-4721-a831-6e68e244ce24)

I think this looks a little bit too cloowny.. I do still like the unstable lay-overs. But I definitly need to go with dark mode.  
Maybe I should explore glitchy textures a bit as well. 

## Entry 25/10/2023 - Aesthetics ## 
Hallelujah! I inally finsih that damn "quick'' easy sketch I was going to do lol.

I still kind of like the unstable identity glitch idea. Or trying to communicate the idea of instability and fluidity through the design of the app.

I also started on the Figma for  the webpage but honestly, I'm just too tired man. I'll continue tomorrow.

## Entry 25/10/2023 - realization ##

So now I am looking into React, and the idea is to make a Figma prototype, and see if that can be turned into React with a tool. I suppose that from there I can ask for help in letting it make API calls to GPT. 

The planning for now is out of the window. 
I really need some support from Rilla and/or Minha... 

I'll also have to look more into learning to understand React and find a tool to go from Figma to React. 

As far for the tool, my first Youtube tutorial attempt is actually making it seem like it's not too much of a hassle. 
SO far I've learned that there's Vite or kind of a slower way to go from Figma to React JS 
and theres the Rendition tool that will create component directly. 
I'll have to watch these full tutorials sometime soon to see if that would work. 

## Entry 24/10/2023 - maybe go back to drawing board ##

Just spoke to Rachel, she mentioned that maybe the whole assistent thing is not going to work out...  
However some other things I could try in the meanwhil is to WoZ somethings, or influence apps. I can also look up React Native. 
I definitly need a chat with Rilla to iron some things down because I need to make soething real soon. 

one thing I do know: is that I want to stimulate discussion around human-like interactions with computers. 

I'm just not sure what I want exactly. 

Rachel also mentioned mturk, red door and snow crash. 

## Entry 24/10/2023 -realization ## 

So Shahrom, Max and Rilla helped me out a lot by explaining the inner workings of it all and what I can best do in order to make this work: 

So I got very stuck on the realization part, as I didn't know how to code and there would be inbetween, 2^5=32 and 5^5=3125 variation based on the slider idea, all with a certain personality tied to it. Essentially way too much. 

What I want is to design a front end with a method of calling GPT over the web. Therefore, mobile design should be left to rest for nowand I should focus on making a working webpage first. Since ky skills in HTML and CSS are basic and incredibly dusty and my skill in JS basically non-existent. I will probably have to use libraries to bear the main load of the prototyping. I was recommended: React, React Native, Angular, Svelte, NextJS, and Nest JS. The can function as a foundation for the webpage and will save me time and effort. As for the realization this will mean that I should look into React Native and look for tools that would turn a Figma file into code/React Native. 

As for the concept having to set different personalities will probably make it harder to code. While having only one set personality would be hard to arguea s to go for which personality exactly. I'm kinda of stuck on this..

## etnry 21/10/2023 - Research process ##

Okay so Max adviced to maybe do one type personality, like Rilla said and base that on the average personality of the people I ask. THat way I would only  have to mae 1 prototype/chatbot. WHich would narrow things down quite a lot. I should also ask Shahrom and Rachel on their opinions. I could ask Miriam for a relieable questionaire. 

From there I would also need to nail down the following: 
 - What type of participant
 - how many participants
 - how to approach the diary study
 - what questions should I ask 

Perhaps this list should be better in the journal? not  sure 

## Entry 20/10/2023 - concept ##

SO far I've received help from Max and Rilla. 
THey also advised me not to continue to think about actually realizing this because it is simply put, too much dam work. 
However, I could continue with a single setting. 

### Question: whih setting/personality should that be and why? ###

alright I'll get bck to you tomorrow. As I also want to finish a drawing so I have atleast something to point when talking about this concept, you know.

## Entry 20/10/2023 - concept ##

I thought it could be interesting to keep a log of the development of my prototype here (I guess that was part of whole GaR project, I'm just a bigger idiot than people think) 
Anways, okay so I don't have too much time right now so I'll copy paste the beginning of the concept here and I guess I'll add more to it later. 

right now I am mostly interested in building a virtual assistant/chatbot that would utilize the big 5 (OCEAN) personality traits. The assistant would be to create a direct interaction and relationship between user and LLM. The research question would be something along the lines of: How do users respond to the introduction of human-like personalities within assistants?  
 
In an ideal world where I could do everything want, I would love to make would be a site/platform/app. For now, let’s say a website, that would have a chat window as well as 5 unmarked sliders corresponding to these 5 traits and give those off to users. I would ideally let users test on the 5 personality traits, and base the starting values for the site on these results (so a personality similar to their own). I would then follow the users over the span of a couple days, and let them play around with the settings, give them some daily tasks, probably doing a diary study. I would close it off with an interview on the user experience and what settings they preferred in what situations and if I could comment on current trend and UX design in general. 
 
However, this is not an ideal world, and I am honestly not sure how to go about this and realize this. I am going to look more into this myself as well, and see how far I could get, but there is also very limited time given the TUe calendar. I could see if I could use Github pages and maybe even generate parts of the code? 
Any and all advise would help a lot.
