SO far I've received help from Max and Rilla. 
THey also advised me not to continue to think about actually realizing this because it is simply put, too much dam work. 
However, I could continue with a single setting. 

### Question: whih setting/personality should that be and why? ###

alright I'll get bck to you tomorrow. As I also want to finish a drawing so I have atleast something to point when talking about this concept, you know.

I thought it could be interesting to keep a log of the development of my prototype here (I guess that was part of whole GaR project, I'm just a bigger idiot than people think) 
Anways, okay so I don't have too much time right now so I'll copy paste the beginning of the concept here and I guess I'll add more to it later. 

right now I am mostly interested in building a virtual assistant/chatbot that would utilize the big 5 (OCEAN) personality traits. The assistant would be to create a direct interaction and relationship between user and LLM. The research question would be something along the lines of: How do users respond to the introduction of human-like personalities within assistants?  
 
In an ideal world where I could do everything want, I would love to make would be a site/platform/app. For now, letâ€™s say a website, that would have a chat window as well as 5 unmarked sliders corresponding to these 5 traits and give those off to users. I would ideally let users test on the 5 personality traits, and base the starting values for the site on these results (so a personality similar to their own). I would then follow the users over the span of a couple days, and let them play around with the settings, give them some daily tasks, probably doing a diary study. I would close it off with an interview on the user experience and what settings they preferred in what situations and if I could comment on current trend and UX design in general. 
 
However, this is not an ideal world, and I am honestly not sure how to go about this and realize this. I am going to look more into this myself as well, and see how far I could get, but there is also very limited time given the TUe calendar. I could see if I could use Github pages and maybe even generate parts of the code? 
Any and all advise would help a lot.
