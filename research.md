## Entry 21/10/2023 ##

So this is going to be a log to keep track of my research 
So far, I have the following plan: 
Investigate the influence of personality based on the big 5 within chatbots/virtual assistents. By making and testing a personality that includes negative aspects but is somewhat similar to users I want to gauge their opinions on assumed UX friendliness as well as HC relation I suppose? 
I aim to do this by making a chatbot/assitent with a personality, let participants talk to the chatbot for a week or so, collect qualitative data on their experiences and see if I can now say something about the inclussion of negative personality qualities within chatbots/virstual assistents.
