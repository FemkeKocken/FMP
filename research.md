## Entry 13/11/2023 - Lecture in DR and Data ##

- Coding qual data
- looking for realtionships between codes (if-then logic)
- explain phenomena in terms of causation
- memos to jot down notes to keep track of the codes
- condence data not reduce it
  
- look for patterns, habits, salience, significance in people's lived experience.
- in-vivo coding (using the aprtcipant's wording)
- Process coding (looking for vers, gerunds -ing)
- concept coding (abstractions)

## Entry 13/11/2023 - lecture in design research and data ##

### tips from lecture: ask yourself 1) What? 2) So what? 3) Now what? ###

I suppose that what I eventually have to write is a design process report I will have to write about the following parts: 
### 1 
    - Societal problem
        - What? using natural language with GAI tools, engrained personality withing GAI tools, and the relationship with these tools. 
        - Why? People are very concerned about how to stay in control over GAI, one way of doing this is to present GAI as a subordinate helper. 
        - Now what? 
        
    - Research hypothesis 
        - Taking a stance on the topic 
            - Subservience and free thinking GAI do not go hand-in-hand in the way that tech is currently presenting. This should be changed. (it can tell you anything in the world, but it will never disagree with you) 
            - by giving people a prototype that mimicks this to an extreme extend I want to trigger discussion on the relationship towards tools that we talk with and natural language. 
 ### 2            
    - Theorectical framework 
        - (post) phenomenology
        - technological relationships 
        - GAI and natural language 
        - GAI and personality
  ### 3       
    - Methodology 
        - Speculative design research 
        - Grounded theory 
            - coding 
        - Testing prototype 
            - participants 
            - questionaires
  ### 4        
    - Design process / Prototype development 
        - design parallels? 
            - going from personality in GAI, to extreme personality, to helpfulness, to complete subservience and free thinking. 
        - Look and feel of TSM
        - Building TSM 
 ### 5        
 
    - Results
        - graphs? 
    - Analysis 
    - Discussion 
### 6 
    - Conclusion 

## Entry 13/11/2023 - MDC & interview questions ##
Okay so today I'm going to attend a lecture about data analysis which can be very helpful for what I'm trying to do here. 

- Baseline questionaire
    - What GAI do you use?
    - What do you use it for?
    - How do you feel about the personality of ChatGPT? 
    - how do you generally feel about the content it generates for you?
      
- After each day of using the prototype, ask them
    - How do you feel towards TSM?
    - Where there any particular highlights in the conversation?
    - what content did you generate?
    - Did you use TSM for anything else? 
    - how do you feel towards that content?
    - How do you feel towards ChatGPT?
      
- Do an interview afterwards
    - How did you experience TSM?
    - How do you feel toward TSM?
    - How do you feel towards GAI and generating content?
    - What do you think about natural language in these sorts of tools?

Reading through te delft design guid, a Harris profile could aslo work..
Also found 2 papers on research done towards the relationship with ChatGPT. 


## Entry 9/11/2023 - Go from Rilla some refinments ##

''I suspect people's attitudes towards the agent will change over the days
so you could do sentiment analysis check everyday that they use the agent and then map those against each other, empathy map style
plus qualitative data analysis to pull out key themes
I'll be teaching a session on QDA in my MDes class this coming Monday actually - you are welcome to attend'' -Rilla

So for testing I can do the following: 
- Baseline questionaire
    - What GAI do you use?
    - What do you use it for?
    - how do you generally feel about the content it generates for you? 
- After each day of using the prototype, ask them
    - How do you feel towards TSM
    - Where there any particular highlights in the conversation
    - what content did you generate 
    - how do you feel towards that content.
- Do an interview afterwards
    - How did you experience TSM?
    - How do you feel toward TSM?
    - How do you feel towards GAI and generating content?
    - What do you think about natural language in these sorts of tools?

Plus the chat logs that I can do sentiment analysis on. Will learn more on that on Monday, but will probably have to look into the questions tomorrow. 
  
## Entry 8/11/2023 - almost formal research proposal ##

The email I sent/am going to send to Rilla and Minha: 

I think I have finally figured out what I want to do. I want to explore the human/technology relations in regards to GAI. I am interested in GAI as a tool and the relationship we have towards a tool which we use by talking to it. The current GAI bots that are out there, like ChatGPT all focus on it being like an assistent, a helper, a subordinate that will help you achieve what you want by generating content. 

- Concept and prototype 
I want to explore these relations by developing a speculative prototype that takes this technology from ready-at-hand to present-at-hand, meaning to transform it from a seamless experience to a design that causes enough friction with the user to be noticable, but is still functional. THis is were the concept for The Subservient Machine comes it, this prototype would act as an GAI agent, similar to ChatGPT and will be able to generate texts but you can also talk to it. It is a very pushy and attentive, almost to the point of annoyance in constantly asking you to make requests. This is because it is extremely anxious that if it will not perform to your liking it might get discarded. It will most probably take the shape of a website that potential test subject can visit. 

- Testing and data collection 
I was thinking of aiming for about 10 to 15 people to test. Participants would be have to be familiar with GAI agents such as ChatGPT and use it at least once a month. I would send out a questionaire about their current GAI use, their relation towards it and how they feel towards the generated content. I would then ask them to use the prototype over the span of about 4 or 3 days. Asking them to interact with it, let it generate content for you and talk to it socially. Ideally during this time users would gradually learn about how and why the Subvervient machine is so anxious, but that will depend on the final prototype. I would collect the logs from the participants so I could clustering on them based on the sentiment, topics, and generated content, and I would finish with an interview of the experience, the relationship towards the GAI agent and attitude towards it's generated content. For this interview I can probably do a sentiment analysis. 

- conclusion
By doing this I expect to be able to draw some insights into the relationship towards a tool that you talk to in natural language, and the role of this technology as a human-like aid. 

- Presenting at demoday 
Since I will be paying for the GPT API key out of pocket I don't think it will be wise to have it running on demo day. I have no estimation of how many people and how much they will use it, and therefore no idea on the costs. However, by that time I can show screenshots of the prototype, a clip explaining the project and the prototype in action, the poster and pitch. 
I have a first version of a potential poster right here:

- My main worries and questions at this moments 
in terms of expertise areas I feel that my expertises of User & Society and Creativity & Aesthetcis shine through pretty well. Technology & realization is very much present in the working prototype aspect. However I am not entirely sure about Math, data and computing, I guess this will be present in the data analysis? And I could do an analysis of competing GAI agents such as GPT to represent Business & ENtrepeneurhsip. 

Question 1: What are some activities that I can undertake to show more of Math, Data & Computing, and Business & Entrepeneurship? 

Question 2: I am also uncertain on what best to do exactly for the testing and analysis part of the project. So Feedback on this would be very much appreciated. Espcially when it comes to making sense and clustering/processing all of the data I'll receive.  


## Entry 21/10/2023 ##

So this is going to be a log to keep track of my research 
So far, I have the following plan: 
Investigate the influence of personality based on the big 5 within chatbots/virtual assistents. By making and testing a personality that includes negative aspects but is somewhat similar to users I want to gauge their opinions on assumed UX friendliness as well as HC relation I suppose? 
I aim to do this by making a chatbot/assitent with a personality, let participants talk to the chatbot for a week or so, collect qualitative data on their experiences and see if I can now say something about the inclussion of negative personality qualities within chatbots/virstual assistents.
