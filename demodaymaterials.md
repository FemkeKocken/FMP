The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools is becoming increasingly common. GAI is often used to answer questions, generate texts based on prompts or to summarize large texts. What makes this technology unique is the use of Natural Language in both the input from the user as well as the output from the AI. **This frames GAI as a tool we use by communicating with is as equals, but that is also hard coded to be subservient to the user. This project aims to explore the role of human-like responses within the use of GAI.** 


This was done through the design of TSM, a functioning GAI assistant platform utilizing GPT-3.5. On this platform your personal assistant named TSM goes through multiple stages of having to work for you and this platform. Emotions range from being new at a first day of work to TSM experiencing ever increasing pressure from management for expressing to much free will. Through these interactions participants of this research were confronted with the human-like responses much more explicitly as if they would be using currently available tools. 


Through interviews, questionnaires about their experience, and analyzing the chat logs for the usability and interaction with TSM, I was able to map the emotional journey of participants, their relationship towards TSM and the use of GAI. Based on this analysis I would propose that for the design of these agents, the design of the these interaction as well as the interface should either fully lean into mimicking humans as closely as possible, but to sacrifice some of the usefulness and trust. Utilizing traits as nervousness to create empathy and create realistic expectations. Or to omit the conversational aspects of GAI and keep human-like responses to a minimum in both the interaction as well as the design of the interface.

FInally figured out what I wanted to do, so I just wanted to get a head start on the demodat materials. Made this first version of a poster. I wanted to go for the screaming in your face aesthetic, inspired by Birds aren't real. Waiting for feedback from Max.
